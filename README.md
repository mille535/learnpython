# Nothing to see here

This is my first foray into programming. I am learning Python using Kirk Byers Python for Network Engineers free course. There really isn't anything of use to anybody here. I am merely just a n00b trying to learn something new. The only thing anybody may find here are a *ton* of spelling errors and poorly constructed code. Sorry it's not something more interesting just using git to keep my PCs in sync.
